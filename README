Developed in collaboration with Ethan Law.

This code runs on a PIC18F45K22 microcontroller that
unlocks a door with a servo when the correct tag is read.
The hardware was originally run by a Raspberry Pi, but
obviously that was way overpowered for this application.
We did this for our Microcontrollers class final project.
